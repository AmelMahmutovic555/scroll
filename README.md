# scroll

The scroll project is a project that diplays a simple website that has a navigation bar and Explore Tours button. When the user scrolls through the website the navigation bar changes from transparent background color to white background color plus a up arrow button appears on the bottom right of the page when the user clicks that button it automatically brings him back to the beggining of the site and changes the white background color of the navigation bar to transparent background color. Now when the user clicks one of the buttons in the navigation bar it takes him to that portion of the website for example if the user clicks the About button it takes him to the About Us portion of the website.
